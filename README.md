# MidTerm_Njeri

This project is about creating A course outline that guides students in Africa Digital Media Institute

The project contains the following branches:

1. Time of the Day
2. The particular day of the week


In the first screenshot, we see a simple code where we went to an application called JavaFX Builder and used the following items

. AnchorPane
. GridPane
The AnchorPane serves as the parent layout while the GridPane acts as the child. The GridPane contains selected number of rows and columns depending on the timetable one has; in this case 5 rows and 6 columns after which you save your work in the FXML document on your project
