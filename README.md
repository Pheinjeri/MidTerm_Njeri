# MidTerm_Faith

This project is about creating A course outline that guides students in Africa Digital Media Institute

The project contains the following branches:

1. Time of the Day
2. The particular day of the week


In the first screenshot, we see a simple code where we went to an application called JavaFX Builder and used the following items

. AnchorPane
. GridPane

The AnchorPane serves as the parent layout while the GridPane acts as the child. The GridPane contains selected number of rows and columns depending on the timetable one has; in this case 5 rows and 6 columns after which you save your work in the FXML document on your project

In the code part, we initialized the GridPane then added labels into the GridPane.

Initialize the days of the week in the code and assign them the particular subjects according to the time assigned and add for loops into the code in that when the day is less than five, it adds a day into the pane.

Continue with the same process until you come with a complete timetable.
